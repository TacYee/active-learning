In most real-world applications, labelled data is scarce. Suppose you are given the MNIST dataset 
(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), but without any labels in the training set. The labels are held in a database, 
which you may query to reveal the label of any particular image it contains. Your task is to build a classifier 
to >90% accuracy on the test set, using the smallest number of queries to this database.  
 
You may use any combination of techniques you find suitable (supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised). 
However, using other datasets or pre-trained models is not allowed.
